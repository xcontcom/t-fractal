# T-fractal

![Preview](images/preview.png)

A small web app to create fractals by layering a simple seed pattern at different scales.

## How It Works

You start with a small pattern called a seed - like a 4Ã—4 grid of 0s and 1s.

This seed is repeated to fill the entire 2D matrix.

Then we make the seed bigger (twice as big), and fill the matrix again - but instead of clearing it, we accumulate the new values with the existing ones.

We keep doing this: make the seed bigger, fill again, and accumulate again.

In the end, each cell in the matrix contains a number showing how many times it was hit with a 1.

Then we color the result - using grayscale, rainbow, or CGA palettes - based on the final number in each cell.
